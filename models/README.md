# Models

All of the models trained during the research are available in this directory. Each model's name starts with either `ecfp`, for the linear models based on extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs), or `gnn`, for the graph neural network (GNN) models. The name also indicates which subset of the Qin data the models were trained/tested on: either all of the data, or just the nonionic surfactants.
