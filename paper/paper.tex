%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.

%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author

%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each

%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This

%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

\begin{tocentry}

    I'm looking for ideas for the TOC graphical entry -- common practice seems
    to be to draw a really abstract picture of a molecule going through a
    network, but that doesn't seem like the best thing to do here because I'm
    specifically comparing against other models.

\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents a novel approach to predicting critical micelle
    concentrations (CMCs) using graph neural networks (GNNs) augmented with
    Gaussian Processes (GPs). The proposed model uses learned latent space
    representations of molecules to predict CMCs and estimate uncertainties. The
    performance of the model on a dataset containing nonionic, cationic, anionic
    and zwitterionic molecules, is compared against a linear model that works
    with extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs). Our results demonstrate
    that the GNN-based model performs slightly better than the linear ECFP
    model, when there is enough well-balanced training data, and achieves
    predictive accuracy that is comparable to published models that were
    evaluated on a smaller range of surfactant chemistries. But the main benefit
    of the GNN model is the ability to provide uncertainty estimates. We
    illustrate the applicability domain of our model using a visualisation of
    the latent space, which helps identify molecules likely to have erroneous
    predictions. The proposed approach can help in the design of new surfactants
    and provide valuable insights into the molecular properties that influence
    CMCs.
