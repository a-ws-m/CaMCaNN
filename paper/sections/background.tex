\citet{puvvadaMolecularThermodynamicApproach1990} derived a phenomenological
model for studying aqueous nonionic surfactant systems that enabled CMC
prediction and modelling other properties across a range of temperatures. The

expand on it for e.g. mixtures of surfactants.

model they developed was the product of decomposing the process of micellisation
into discrete steps that they could describe thermodynamically so as to yield a
description of the free energy of micellisation in terms of a set of molecular
parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The tail length, defined as the number of carbon atoms.
    \item The average cross-sectional area of the headgroup, which controls the
          steric contribution to the free energy. This must be estimated.
    \item The Tolman length of the tail, which effectively describes the
          thickness of an `interaction region' around the tail
          \cite{demiguelGibbsThermodynamicsSurface2021}. This must also be estimated.
\end{itemize}

The authors developed a method to estimate these parameters for linear,
nonionic, polyoxyethylene alcohol surfactants. The model attained impressive
accuracy for some predictions: a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of approximately
\SI{0.14}{\log \micro M} for the group \ce{C10E_i}, where $i \in [3, 6]$, and
\SI{0.21}{\log \micro M} for the group \ce{C12E_j}, where $j \in [3, 8]$.
However, the error is much larger for other systems, like \ce{C8E6}. The authors
ascribed this inaccuracy to their prediction that these systems' micelles would
not exhibit much anisotropic growth, i.e. that they are mostly spherical;
rather, their model is better suited for cylindrical or disk-like (bilayer)
micelles.

The connection this model established between a small set of physically meaningful properties that can be estimated and emergent properties of surfactants is extremely useful, especially because it does not explicitly require fitting to any experimental data. However, the procedures described for estimating the Tolman length are only applicable to linear hydrocarbon chains, not branched nor heterogeneous tail groups. Estimating the average cross-sectional area of the head group may also not be trivial.

Greater generalisability and better accuracy can be realised by considering the
process of aggregation on a more precise level: identifying the behaviour of
individual atoms, or small groups thereof. Simulation approaches can model the
interaction of these units with each other and derive the potential energy of a
configuration from these calculations.

TODO: References.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations treat individual atoms, in the all-atomistic
(AA) approach, or groups of atoms, in the coarse-grained (CG) approach, as
particles in a box that exert force on each other. This allows the particles'
movement to be simulated by integrating the equations of motion.
\citet{jorgeMolecularDynamicsSimulation2008} used two types of AA approach to
simulate the self-assembly of \textit{n}-decyltrimethylammonium bromide: one
approach that explicitly considered hydrogens, and the united-atom approach, which
groups hydrogens with their respective connecting atom. They then estimated the
CMC by considering the concentration of `free' surfactants, i.e. surfactants
that were not in micelles, which they defined as an aggregate containing five or
more surfactants. The more accurate model for determining CMC, the united-atom
approach, yielded a CMC with an error of \SI{0.23}{\log \micro M}. The author
asserted that the simulation size, i.e. the number of particles, was too small
to obtain a more accurate value of CMC. This highlights an issue with using MD
to predict CMC: careful consideration must be given to ensure that the system is
large enough and that enough timesteps have been performed to ensure
convergence, but increasing these parameters leads to an increase in
computational cost.

TODO: Reference Panagiotopoulos and commentary on whether atomistic FFs can be used
to predict CMC.

The computational cost in increasing the system size can be mitigated using
coarse-graining, which reduces the number of interactions that must be computed
by grouping atoms into beads, as well as enabling larger time steps, meaning
that the same timescale can be simulated with fewer rounds of calculation
\cite{fitzgeraldMultiscaleModelingNanomaterials2015}. These beads must be
modelled differently than individual atoms and there are a few approaches to
this. \citet{vishnyakovPredictionCriticalMicelle2013} used dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) to model the CMCs of \ce{C8E8}, dodecyldimethylamineoxide (DDAO)
and \textit{N}-decanoyl-\textit{N}-methyl-\textsc{D}-glucamide (MEGA-10). They
proposed a methodology for obtaining reasonable parameters to describe the bead
interactions based on known infinite dilution coefficients, $\gamma_\infty$.
Their calculated CMC for \ce{C8E8} had an error relative to the average
experimental value equal to \SI{0.07}{\log \micro M}, for DDAO it was
\SI{0.06}{\log \micro M}, and for MEGA-10 it was \SI{0.06}{\log \micro M}.

Clearly, this approach can produce extremely accurate results. However, it is
limited to compounds that can be parameterised by a known $\gamma_\infty$.
Furthermore, the authors do not discuss parameterising ionic surfactants, for
which more complex interactions must be considered. Despite the reduced cost
relative to AA-MD models of the same system scales, CG-MD approaches are still
one of the more expensive approaches to CMC prediction. But MD simulations give
very deep insight into the processes occurring at a molecular level; its results
yield a precise description of the arrangement of molecules in a system, their
shape and aggregation number, which is a level of detail other approaches do not
come close to achieving.

Another approach is to reduce the scale of the simulation by only considering
the effect of individual molecules and local interactions. The conductor-like
screening model (COSMO) provides a tool for decomposing the problem by treating
a molecule as a cavity with a charged surface in a solvent that acts as a
dielectric continuum \cite{klamtCOSMONewApproach1993}. The cavity's surface is
described by the solvent-accessible surface of the molecule. The geometry of
this surface combined with a segment-wise description of its polarising charges
is called the COSMO-surface and it can be calculated using density functional
theory (DFT).

COSMO for realistic solvation (COSMO-RS) adapts the model for more complex types
of solvent \cite{klamtCOSMORSAlternativeSimulation2010}. Solvents only act like
a dielectric continuum when they are capable of perfectly screening the
COSMO-surface of a solute, i.e. every point on the molecule's COSMO surface is
matched by a point of opposite polarity due to the configuration of the solvent
molecules. COSMO-RS uses statistical mechanics to determine the probability
distribution describing how surface charge densities align between two
molecules. This allows chemical potentials to be determined.

\citet{turchiFirstprinciplesPredictionCritical2022} used COSMO-RS to predict
CMCs by treating a micelle as a separate phase and then considering the
two-phase equilibrium between the micelle and an aqueous phase containing free
surfactants. They modelled the micellar `phase' using two strategies. Their
first strategy was to treat the micellar phase as being equivalent to a bulk,
homogeneous phase of surfactant. The CMC could then be determined by the
equilibrium surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase. In actuality,
micelles are structured and inhomogeneous; the authors argued that this
approximation is more valid as the difference in polarity between the head and
tail of a surfactant is reduced, which was the case for the majority of nonionic
surfactants they considered.

Their second strategy was to consider the micellar phase as a bulk, homogeneous
phase of an oil, whose chemistry was analogous to that of the surfactant's tail
group. They then implemented an iterative procedure to calculate the interfacial
tension (IFT) between the oil and aqueous surfactant phases at different
concentrations of surfactant. The concentration at which the IFT is zero yields
the CMC prediction. The premise of this approach is that the oil phase is
representative of a micelle's interior, containing primarily tail groups, which
is particularly true as the interactions between head and tail groups become
more unfavourable. This is the case for highly polar head groups: primarily for
ionic surfactants.

The authors recommended applying both strategies and using the lower result as
the CMC prediction. With the combined strategies, they attained an RMSE of
\SI{0.81}{\log \micro M} on a dataset of 24 surfactants, containing a mix of
ionic, nonionic and zwitterionic. Excluding the two worst predictions gives a
much more favourable RMSE of \SI{0.55}{\log \micro M}. Although the accuracy of
these models is lower than those achieved by others, it is notable that the
technique can be applied across all classes of surfactant. Furthermore, the
authors were able to determine which of the nonionic surfactants had a low
propensity to form micelles by whether the predicted IFT between water and
surfactant phases was large at equilibrium, which is a testament to the model's
interpretability.

Other approaches have extended COSMO-RS to explicitly account for the internal
structure of micelles, such as COSMOmic, which treats a micelle as being made of
concentric layers that each have their own surface charge profiles
\cite{klamtCOSMOmicMechanisticApproach2008}. To compute these charge profiles,
the layer's composition with respect to individual atoms of the surfactant must
be known; this can be determined using MD. The combination of layer-wise atomic
distributions and the COSMO-surface associated with each atom gives the layer's
surface charge density profile. COSMOmic considers how the COSMO-surface of a
surfactant would intersect with the layers' surface charge profiles when it is
randomly positioned and oriented within the micelle, in order to determine the
partition coefficient of inserting a surfactant molecule into the micelle.

\citet{jakobtorweihenPredictingCriticalMicelle2017} calculated CMCs using
COSMOmic by first performing MD simulations to attain the layer-wise atomic
distributions. The authors then predicted the CMCs of several polyoxyethylene
alcohols by determining the partition coefficients of inserting the respective
surfactant monomer into a micelle.

Although it was found that the choice of conformer used to describe the micellar
layer-wise charge density profiles has a negligible effect on the results
\cite{jakobtorweihenCombinationCOSMOmicMolecular2013}, the conformer used for
the partitioning surfactant is important. With the best choice of conformer, the
authors achieved an RMSE of $\sim \SI{0.36}{\log \micro M}$ on predictions for
\ce{C_$i$E6} surfactants, where $i \in \{6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16\}$. However, when
considering surfactants with fixed tail length but varying head group size,
\ce{C10E_$j$}, $j \in {4, 6, 8}$, the authors could not identify a consistent
conformer selection that would not yield significant outliers.

Finally, COSMOplex is a recent extension of COSMOmic that removes the need to
perform and initial MD simulation to determine the micellar structure
\cite{klamtCOSMOplexSelfconsistentSimulation2019}. Instead, it optimises a guess
of the initial structure using a self-consistent approach by considering
COSMOmic's predicted probability distribution of the partitioning surfactant's
configuration within the micelle to iteratively yield new estimates for the
layer-wise charge distributions. In this way, the authors predicted the CMCs of
10 nonionic surfactants with varied head and tail group chemistries, achieving
an RMSE of \SI{0.86}{\log \micro M}. The authors note that these results are
preliminary and stand to be improved.

COSMO techniques are promising; however,
\citet{herbertDielectricContinuumMethods2021} have argued that the discussion
around COSMO-RS indicates that there is not enough detail in the literature to
allow for an open source implementation, meaning that many modern extensions are
only available in the proprietary software package \textsc{COSMOTHERM}
\cite{eckertFastSolventScreening2002}.

Another approach is to use an equation of state with a much less complex
functional form to determine the CMC. The reduction in complexity can be
achieved using a semi-empirical method that is parameterised by fitting to
experimental data.

\citet{liStudiesUNIQUACSAFT1998} applied a segment-based UNIQUAC model
(s-UNIQUAC) and a SAFT equation of state to predict CMCs of linear
polyoxyethylene alcohols by first deriving expressions for the activity
coefficient of a surfactant in water. In the s-UNIQUAC model, a segment-based
local-composition model was used, and the fugacity could then be approximated
using the fitted interaction energies between the segments and water. In this
case, the segments used were \ce{C2H4} and \ce{C2H4O}. In the SAFT approach, the
surfactant was treated as a chain of soft-sphere segments in order to first
derive the free energy of the solution and, from that, derive the fugacity.

\citet{chengCorrelationCriticalMicelle2005} compared the performance of these
models on a larger dataset alongside three other models. Two of these were
segment-based models: the polymer-NRTL model \cite{liStudiesUNIQUACSAFT1998} and
a UNIFAC model \cite{voutsasPredictionCriticalMicelle2001}. The authors also
employed their own modified Aranovich and Donohue (m-AD) model. The m-AD model
calculates the CMC as a mole fraction, $x_S^L$, approximating it as the
reciprocal of the limiting value of the surfactant's activity coefficient in an
aqueous solution, $\gamma_S^{L,\infty}$:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:m-AD}
    x_S^L = \frac{1}{\gamma_S^{L,\infty}}
\end{equation}

The m-AD model considers the exchange equilibrium on a three-dimensional lattice
of infinitely separated solvent and solute molecules in order to determine
$\gamma_S^{L,\infty}$. Notably, the m-AD model is not a segment-based model;
instead, the authors fitted an interchange energy, $\Delta$, separately for each
molecule. Correlations were examined between $\Delta$ and other, readily
calculated surfactant values: the Kier-Hall zero-order index (KH0) of the tail
groups, which indicates  and the total molecular energy of the surfactant.

Where data from the literature was available, the predictive performance of the
models on the molecular series \ce{C_nE6}, \ce{C_nE8}, \ce{C_nE9}, \ce{C10E_n}
and \ce{C12E_n} were compared, and the resulting RMSEs are summarised in Table
\ref{tab:segment-methods}. The models all have a reasonably good accuracy, but
the SAFT model is particularly remarkable.

Segment-based semi-empirical methods are very promising for predicting CMCs
within a class of surfactants. Their major drawback is that they are only
applicable to molecules that can be decomposed into segments that have trained
parameters. In addition, they must respect the limitations of the theories they
are based upon. For example, it was described earlier how the SAFT model needs
special treatment to be applied to these polyoxyethylene alcohol surfactants,
requiring a function to describe a segment's soft sphere diameter with respect
to the chain length. A more complex function would be required when branching is
introduced, or when chains can be made up of combinations of different units,
and it is difficult to make these adaptations.

Finally, purely empirical methods have a very heavy reliance on data abundance.
Empirical methods offer a way of making predictions even when a unified theory
that ties in the behaviour of several classes of molecules is not readily
apparent, or else when the theory requires computationally expensive procedures
to put into practice. However, without an underlying theory, the assumptions and
therefore the limitations of the model are not well defined and it is possible
for the model to `learn' trends that contradict scientific intuition.

Empirical QSPR methods require validation to determine their reliability and
applicability domain
\cite{veerasamyValidationQSARModelsstrategies2011,tropshaBestPracticesQSAR2010,leonardSelectionTrainingTest2006},
which is often achieved by partitioning the available data into \emph{training}
and \emph{test} subsets; the former is used for optimising the model's
parameters, but the latter is `hidden' from the model until training is
complete, and the prediction metrics on the test data indicate how the model can
be expected to perform in general. The test set should span the chemical space
in which the model is intended to be applied
\cite{leonardSelectionTrainingTest2006}. At a high level, this means that all
classes of surfactant that are within the applicability domain of the model
should be represented in both the test and train data subsets.

Some of the alternative goals of empirical QSPR models are that they are general
enough to be applicable to a diverse range of compounds; they can be used to
design novel molecules with target properties
\cite{gantzerInverseQSPRNovoDesign2020,bolboacaMolecularDesignQSARs2013}; and
that they are interpretable \cite{zefirovFragmentalApproachQSPR2002}, meaning
that they can be analysed to glean chemical insights.

Every empirical QSPR method is characterised by two features: the choice of
molecular descriptors, which are the numerical features that make up the model
inputs, and the functional form of the approximator that maps the descriptors to
the property prediction. This functional form includes the parameters that are
optimised based upon the training data.

\citet{matteiModelingCriticalMicelle2013} extended the Marrero and Gani
group-contribution method \cite{ganiAutomaticCreationMissing2005} to predict the
CMCs of 150 nonionic surfactants. This is another segment-based method, but here
the pretence of describing the problem in terms of the effect of interacting
segments is abandoned. Instead, each segment is treated as an independent
\emph{group} that contributes to the prediction in an additive, linear fashion.

The descriptors in this case are the number of each group present in a molecule.
In the original method \cite{ganiAutomaticCreationMissing2005}, different
`orders' of groups were identified; the first-order groups are forbidden from
overlapping with one another and they are formulated so that any molecule of
interest can be described using these groups exclusively. Higher order groups
serve to distinguish polyfunctional molecules and isomers
\cite{ganiAutomaticCreationMissing2005}.

\citet{matteiModelingCriticalMicelle2013} introduced third-order groups to
improve their model's accuracy by analysing the molecules with the highest
prediction errors after training an initial model with just the prior work's set
of first- and second-order groups \cite{ganiAutomaticCreationMissing2005}. This
is an example of \emph{feature selection}, whereby the set of descriptors is
expanded or contracted to adapt to the problem
\cite{liFeatureSelectionData2017,guyonIntroductionVariableFeature2003}.

The authors randomly selected 30 compounds to use as a test dataset, achieving a
RMSE of \SI{0.13}{\log \micro M}. The model is therefore remarkably accurate and
boasts high interpretability: the fitted contributions of each group describe
their effect on the CMC quantitatively, and the existence of higher order
polyfunctional groups with large contributions implies that their constituent
functional groups have a significant interaction with each other that affects
the CMC. However, it may be difficult to determine whether a new molecule is
within the applicability domain of the model, particularly because positional
isomers are not necessarily distinguished from each other using the group
representation.

Recently, an approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) has produced highly
accurate predictions whilst being applicable to nonionic, cationic, anionic and
zwitterionic surfactants simultaneously \cite{qinPredictingCriticalMicelle2021}.
Neural networks have many trainable parameters and a complex functional form.
This ensures their versatility as universal approximators but makes them highly
susceptible to overfitting \cite{bejaniSystematicReviewOverfitting2021}. This
approach boasts potentially the largest applicability domain (for a single set
of trained parameters) of any model discussed previously.

GNN approaches, like the one of \citet{qinPredictingCriticalMicelle2021},
operate on molecular graphs, which are characterised by atomic nodes whose edges
represent bonds. Each operation on this graph considers just the local
environment of an atom, i.e. the atoms that can be reached by traversing a
single bond, but by stacking these operations in sequence, the size of the
environment that is considered increases. In this sense the model is similar to
a group contribution approach, but the groups are determined by walking $r$
steps along bonds from every atom in the molecule, where $r$ is equal to the
number of subsequent graph operations, so that every group overlaps.
Furthermore, each `contribution' is non-linear, and the number of contributions
is always equal to the number of atoms in a molecule. A more detailed discussion
of GNNs will be given in the Method.

We recognise that deep neural networks' ostensible `universality' can be
misleading: extrapolating the model's results to out-of-domain molecules (ones
that are `dissimilar' from the training data) will yield unreliable and
potentially erroneous predictions. It is also not readily apparent which
molecules are in-domain without having an intimate knowledge of the training
data; this becomes very difficult, as we wish to use the largest possible size
of training dataset.
