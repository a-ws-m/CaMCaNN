\citet{puvvadaMolecularThermodynamicApproach1990} derived a phenomenological
model for studying aqueous nonionic surfactant systems that enabled prediction
of CMC and other properties across a range of temperatures. They developed a
model for the free energy of micellization, from which the CMC can be
calculated. Their model was parameterized by three properties of the surfactant
molecule:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The tail length, defined as the number of carbon atoms.
    \item The average cross-sectional area of the headgroup, which controls the
          steric contribution to the free energy. This must be estimated.
    \item The Tolman length of the tail, which approximates the thickness of an
          `interaction region' around the tail
          \cite{demiguelGibbsThermodynamicsSurface2021}. This must also be
          estimated.
\end{itemize}

The authors developed a method to estimate parameters for linear, nonionic,
polyoxyethylene alcohol surfactants. The model attained a root-mean-squared
error (RMSE) of approximately \SI{0.14}{\log \micro M} for the group
\ce{C10E_i}, where $i \in (3, 6)$, and \SI{0.21}{\log \micro M} for the group
\ce{C12E_j}, where $j \in (3, 8)$. However, the error is much larger for other
systems, like \ce{C8E6}. The authors ascribed this inaccuracy to their
prediction that the micelles in these systems would not exhibit much anisotropic
growth, i.e. that they are mostly spherical; their model is better suited for
cylindrical or disk-like (bilayer) micelles.

The connection this model established between a small set of physically meaningful properties that can be estimated and emergent properties of surfactants is extremely useful, especially because it does not explicitly require fitting to any experimental data. However, the procedures described for estimating the Tolman length are only applicable to linear hydrocarbon chains, not branched nor heterogeneous tail groups. Estimating the average cross-sectional area of the head group may also not be trivial.

Greater generalizability and better accuracy can be realized by considering the
process of aggregation by identifying the behavior of individual atoms, or
small groups thereof. Simulation approaches can model the interaction of these
units with each other and derive the potential energy of a configuration
\cite{frenkelUnderstandingMolecularSimulation2001,joshiReviewAdvancementsCoarsegrained2021,filipeMolecularDynamicsSimulations2022}.
For example, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations treat individual atoms, in the
all-atomistic (AA) approach, or groups of atoms, in the coarse-grained (CG)
approach, as particles in a box that exert force on each other. This allows the
particles' movement to be simulated by integrating the equations of motion.

\citet{jorgeMolecularDynamicsSimulation2008} used two approaches to simulate the
self-assembly of \textit{n}-decyltrimethylammonium bromide: an AA approach, and
a united-atom approach, which groups hydrogens with their respective connecting
atom. They then estimated the CMC by considering the concentration of `free'
surfactants, i.e. surfactants that were not in micelles, which they defined as
an aggregate containing five or more surfactants. The united-atom approach
yielded a CMC with an error of \SI{0.23}{\log \micro M}. The author asserted
that the simulation size, i.e. the number of particles, was too small to obtain
a more accurate value of CMC. However,
\citet{jusufiExplicitImplicitSolventSimulations2015} criticized the free
surfactant concentration approach for modelling CMC of ionic surfactants in
general. They note that free surfactant concentration above the CMC is highly
dependent on the choice of overall surfactant concentration, especially for
ionic surfactants, which necessitates careful extrapolation in order to
accurately determine CMCs.

The computational cost from increasing the system size can be mitigated using
coarse-graining, which groups atoms into beads. This also makes simulating
longer time scales accessible
\cite{fitzgeraldMultiscaleModelingNanomaterials2015}.
\citet{vishnyakovPredictionCriticalMicelle2013} used dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) to model the CMCs of \ce{C8E8}, dodecyldimethylamineoxide (DDAO)
and \textit{N}-decanoyl-\textit{N}-methyl-\textsc{D}-glucamide (MEGA-10). They
proposed a methodology for obtaining parameters to describe the bead
interactions based on known infinite dilution activity coefficients,
$\gamma_\infty$. Their calculated CMC for \ce{C8E8} had an error relative to the
average experimental value equal to \SI{0.07}{\log \micro M}, for DDAO it was
\SI{0.06}{\log \micro M}, and for MEGA-10 it was \SI{0.06}{\log \micro M}.

Although this approach can produce extremely accurate results, it is limited to
compounds that can be parameterized by a known $\gamma_\infty$. Furthermore, the
authors do not discuss parameterizing ionic surfactants, for which more complex
interactions must be considered. Despite the reduced cost relative to AA-MD
models of the same system scales, CG-MD approaches are still one of the more
expensive approaches to CMC prediction. Nevertheless, MD simulations give very
deep insight into the processes occurring at a molecular level; their results
yield a precise description of the arrangement of molecules in a system, their
shape and aggregation number.

Another approach is the conductor-like screening model (COSMO), which decomposes
the problem by treating a molecule as a cavity with a charged surface in a
solvent that acts as a dielectric continuum \cite{klamtCOSMONewApproach1993}.
The cavity's surface is described by the solvent-accessible surface of the
molecule. The geometry of this surface combined with a segment-wise description
of its polarizing charges can be mapped using density functional theory (DFT).

COSMO for realistic solvation (COSMO-RS) adapts the model for more complex types
of solvent \cite{klamtCOSMORSAlternativeSimulation2010}. Solvents only act like
a dielectric continuum when they are capable of perfectly screening the
COSMO-surface of a solute, i.e. every point on the molecule's COSMO surface is
matched by a point of opposite polarity due to the configuration of the solvent
molecules. COSMO-RS uses statistical mechanics to determine the probability
distribution describing how surface charge densities align between two
molecules. This allows chemical potentials to be determined.

\citet{turchiFirstprinciplesPredictionCritical2022} used COSMO-RS to predict
CMCs by treating a micelle as a separate phase and then considering the
two-phase equilibrium between the micelle and an aqueous phase containing free
surfactants. They modelled the micellar `phase' using two strategies. Their
first strategy was to treat the micellar phase as being equivalent to a bulk,
homogeneous phase of surfactant. The CMC could then be determined by the
equilibrium surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase. The authors argued
that this approximation is more valid as the difference in polarity between the
head and tail of a surfactant is reduced, which was the case for the majority of
nonionic surfactants they considered.

Their second strategy was to consider the micellar phase as a bulk, homogeneous
phase of an oil, whose chemistry was analogous to that of the surfactant's tail
group. They then implemented an iterative procedure to calculate the interfacial
tension (IFT) between the oil and aqueous surfactant phases at different
concentrations of surfactant. The concentration at which the IFT is zero yields
the CMC prediction. The premise of this approach is that the oil phase is
representative of a micelle's interior, which is particularly true as the
interactions between head and tail groups become more unfavorable. This is the
case for highly polar head groups: primarily for ionic surfactants.

The authors recommended applying both strategies and using the lower result as
the CMC prediction. They attained an RMSE of \SI{0.81}{\log \micro M} on a
dataset of 24 surfactants, containing a mix of ionic, nonionic and zwitterionic
surfactants. Excluding the two worst predictions gives a much more favorable
RMSE of \SI{0.55}{\log \micro M}. It is notable that the technique can be
applied across all classes of surfactants. Furthermore, the authors were able to
determine which of the nonionic surfactants had a low propensity to form
micelles by analyzing the predicted IFT between the water and surfactant phases.
If the predicted IFT was large, this implied that the free energy of
micellization would be large and therefore that the surfactants were less likely
to micellize. This is a testament to the model's interpretability.

Other approaches have extended COSMO-RS to explicitly account for the internal
structure of micelles, such as COSMOmic, which treats a micelle as being made of
concentric layers that each have their own surface charge profiles
\cite{klamtCOSMOmicMechanisticApproach2008}. To compute these charge profiles,
the layer's composition with respect to individual atoms of the surfactant must
be known. The combination of layer-wise atomic distributions and the
COSMO-surface associated with each atom gives the layer's surface charge density
profile. COSMOmic considers how the COSMO-surface of a surfactant would
intersect with the layers' surface charge profiles when it is randomly
positioned and oriented within the micelle, in order to determine the partition
coefficient of inserting a surfactant molecule into the micelle.

\citet{jakobtorweihenPredictingCriticalMicelle2017} calculated CMCs using
COSMOmic by first performing MD simulations to attain the layer-wise atomic
distributions. The authors then predicted the CMCs of several polyoxyethylene
alcohols by determining the partition coefficients of inserting the respective
surfactant monomer into a micelle.

Although it was found that the choice of conformer used to describe the micellar
layer-wise charge density profiles has a negligible effect on the results
\cite{jakobtorweihenCombinationCOSMOmicMolecular2013}, the conformer used for
the partitioning surfactant is important. With the best choice of conformer, the
authors achieved an RMSE of $\sim \SI{0.36}{\log \micro M}$ on predictions for
\ce{C_$i$E6} surfactants, where $i \in \{6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16\}$. However, when
considering surfactants with fixed tail length but varying head group size,
\ce{C10E_$j$}, $j \in {4, 6, 8}$, the authors could not identify a consistent
conformer selection that would not yield significant outliers.

COSMOplex is a recent extension of COSMOmic that removes the need to perform and
initial MD simulation to determine the micellar structure
\cite{klamtCOSMOplexSelfconsistentSimulation2019}. Instead, it optimizes the
micellar structure using a self-consistent approach, which iteratively yields
new estimates for the layer-wise charge distributions. The authors predicted the
CMCs of 10 nonionic surfactants with varied head and tail group chemistries,
achieving an RMSE of \SI{0.86}{\log \micro M}; however, they noted that these
results are preliminary and stand to be improved.

Although COSMO techniques are promising,
\citet{herbertDielectricContinuumMethods2021} note that many modern extensions
are only available in the proprietary software package \textsc{COSMOTHERM}
\cite{eckertFastSolventScreening2002}.

Another approach to predict CMCs is to use an equation of state. The reduction
in complexity can be achieved using a semi-empirical method that is
parameterized by fitting to experimental data.

\citet{liStudiesUNIQUACSAFT1998} applied a segment-based UNIQUAC model
(s-UNIQUAC) and a SAFT equation of state to predict CMCs of linear
polyoxyethylene alcohols by first deriving expressions for the activity
coefficient of a surfactant in water. In the s-UNIQUAC model, a segment-based
local-composition model was used, and the fugacity could then be approximated
using the fitted interaction energies between the segments and water. The
segments used were \ce{C2H4} and \ce{C2H4O}. In the SAFT approach, the
surfactant was treated as a chain of soft-sphere segments in order to first
derive the free energy of the solution and, from that, the fugacity.

\citet{chengCorrelationCriticalMicelle2005} compared the performance of these
models on a larger dataset alongside three other models. Two of these were
segment-based models: the polymer-NRTL model \cite{liStudiesUNIQUACSAFT1998} and
a UNIFAC model \cite{voutsasPredictionCriticalMicelle2001}. The authors also
employed their own modified Aranovich and Donohue (m-AD) model. The m-AD model
calculates the CMC as a mole fraction, $x_S^L$, approximating it as the
reciprocal of the limiting value of the surfactant's activity coefficient in an
aqueous solution, $\gamma_S^{L,\infty}$:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:m-AD}
    x_S^L = \frac{1}{\gamma_S^{L,\infty}}
\end{equation}

The m-AD model considers the exchange equilibrium on a three-dimensional lattice
of infinitely separated solvent and solute molecules in order to determine
$\gamma_S^{L,\infty}$. Notably, the m-AD model is not a segment-based model;
instead, the authors fitted an interchange energy, $\Delta$, separately for each
molecule. Correlations were examined between $\Delta$ and the readily calculated
Kier-Hall zero-order index (KH0) of the tail groups, which indicates and the
total molecular energy of the surfactant.

Where data from the literature was available, the predictive performance of the
equation of state and the m-AD models on the molecular series \ce{C_nE6},
\ce{C_nE8}, \ce{C_nE9}, \ce{C10E_n} and \ce{C12E_n} were compared, and the
resulting RMSEs are summarized in Table \ref{tab:segment-methods}. The models
all have a reasonably good accuracy, but the SAFT model is particularly good.

        alcohols' CMCs. Data from \citet{chengCorrelationCriticalMicelle2005}.}

Segment-based semi-empirical methods are very promising for predicting CMCs
within a class of surfactants. Their major drawback is that they are only
applicable to molecules that can be decomposed into segments that have trained
parameters. In addition, they must respect the limitations of the theories they
are based upon.

Finally, purely empirical methods have a very heavy reliance on data abundance.
Empirical methods offer a way of making predictions even when a unified theory
is lacking or computationally too demanding. However, without an underlying
theory, the limitations of the model are not well defined and it is possible for
the model to `learn' trends that contradict scientific intuition.

Empirical QSPR methods require validation to determine their reliability and
applicability domain
\cite{veerasamyValidationQSARModelsstrategies2011,tropshaBestPracticesQSAR2010,leonardSelectionTrainingTest2006};
the performance metrics during optimization are not a reliable indicator of
generality, or the performance on new molecules. This is often achieved by
partitioning the available data into \emph{training} and \emph{test} subsets;
the former is used for optimizing the model's parameters, the latter is `hidden'
from the model until training is complete, and the prediction metrics on the
test data indicate how the model can be expected to perform in general. The test
set should span the chemical space in which the model is intended to be applied
\cite{leonardSelectionTrainingTest2006}. At a high level, this means that all
classes of surfactant that are within the applicability domain of the model
should be represented in both the test and train data subsets.

Empirical QSPR models are general enough to be applicable to a diverse range of
compounds; they can be used to design novel molecules with target properties
\cite{gantzerInverseQSPRNovoDesign2020,bolboacaMolecularDesignQSARs2013} and are
interpretable \cite{zefirovFragmentalApproachQSPR2002}, meaning that they can be
analyzed to obtain chemical insights.

Every empirical QSPR method is characterized by two features: the choice of
molecular descriptors, which are the numerical features that make up the model
inputs, and the functional form of the approximator that maps the descriptors to
the property prediction. This functional form includes the parameters that are
optimized based upon the training data.

\citet{matteiModelingCriticalMicelle2013} extended the Marrero and Gani
group-contribution method \cite{ganiAutomaticCreationMissing2005} to predict the
CMCs of 150 nonionic surfactants. In this approach, each segment is treated as
an independent \emph{group} that contributes to the prediction in an additive,
linear fashion.

The descriptors are the number of each group present in a molecule. In the
original method \cite{ganiAutomaticCreationMissing2005}, different `orders' of
groups were identified; the first-order groups are forbidden from overlapping
with one another and they are formulated so that any molecule of interest can be
described using these groups exclusively. Higher order groups distinguish
polyfunctional molecules and isomers \cite{ganiAutomaticCreationMissing2005}.

\citet{matteiModelingCriticalMicelle2013} introduced third-order groups to
improve their model's accuracy by analyzing the molecules with the highest
prediction errors after training an initial model with the first- and
second-order groups from a prior work \cite{ganiAutomaticCreationMissing2005}.
This is an example of \emph{feature selection}, whereby the set of descriptors
is expanded or contracted to adapt to the problem
\cite{liFeatureSelectionData2017,guyonIntroductionVariableFeature2003}.

The authors randomly selected 30 compounds as a test dataset, achieving a RMSE
of \SI{0.13}{\log \micro M}. The model is remarkably accurate and boasts high
interpretability: the fitted contributions of each group describe their effect
on the CMC quantitatively, and the existence of higher order polyfunctional
groups with large contributions implies that their constituent functional groups
have a significant interaction with each other that affects the CMC. However, it
may be difficult to determine whether a new molecule is within the applicability
domain of the model, particularly because positional isomers are not necessarily
distinguished from each other using the group representation.

Recently, an approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) has produced highly
accurate predictions whilst being applicable to nonionic, cationic, anionic and
zwitterionic surfactants \cite{qinPredictingCriticalMicelle2021}. Neural
networks have many trainable parameters and a complex functional form. This
ensures their versatility as universal approximators but makes them highly
susceptible to overfitting \cite{bejaniSystematicReviewOverfitting2021}. Neural
networks potentially boast the largest applicability domain (for a single set of
trained parameters) of any model discussed previously.

GNN approaches, like the one of \citet{qinPredictingCriticalMicelle2021},
operate on molecular graphs, which are characterized by atomic nodes whose edges
represent bonds. Each operation on this graph considers just the local
environment of an atom, i.e. the atoms that can be reached by traversing a
single bond, but by stacking these operations in sequence, the size of the
environment that is considered increases. In this sense the model is similar to
a group contribution approach, although the groups are determined by walking $r$
steps along bonds from every atom in the molecule, where $r$ is equal to the
number of subsequent graph operations, so that every group overlaps.
Furthermore, each `contribution' is non-linear, and the number of contributions
is always equal to the number of atoms in a molecule. A more detailed discussion
of GNNs will be given in the Method.
