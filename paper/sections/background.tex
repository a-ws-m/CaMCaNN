Broadly, CMC predictive models take three forms: empirical, theoretical and
simulated, or some combination of the three. Here we will focus on predictive
models for aqueous solutions containing a single surfactant and discuss some of the trade-offs
with the different approaches with regards to speed, universality and interpretability.

TODO: Talk about geometric, topological and electronic descriptors, as well as simulation approaches.
