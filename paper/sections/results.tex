\subsection{ECFP models}



\subsection{GNN models}

\subsubsection{Combined GNN and GP models}

\subsection{Performance on NIST data}

The layout of this should be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe ECFP results: the number of groups after parsing, the number found during optimisation, include best params in supplementary information.
    \item The performance of ECFP on training data.
    \item Describe hyperband results: the number of trials, the best validation error and the resulting topology.
    \item Describe performance of GNNs on test data.
    \item Describe performance of UQ on test data. Show parity plot of its predictions.
    \item Describe performance of all models on NIST data.
    \item Show parity plot of all models on NIST data.
\end{itemize}
