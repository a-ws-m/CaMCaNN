The ideal molecular
representation depends on the task at hand. Ideally, it should be compact but
complete
\cite{faberCrystalStructureRepresentations2015,himanenDScribeLibraryDescriptors2020};
`as simple as possible, but not simpler.' To that end, the representation should
contain enough information to distinguish between isomers that with distinct
properties. However, concessions can be made if we restrict the model's domain
and self-imposed limits on the type of isomers we expose the model to, both
during training and in use. Representations may also include descriptions of
state, such as temperature and pressure \cite{chenGraphNetworksUniversal2019},
but this is redundant in cases where the training data spans a very limited
range of states.
