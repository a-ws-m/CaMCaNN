Empirical models were applied to predict CMCs from two datasets. One dataset was partitioned into training and test data (Qin-All), and a subset of the nonionic surfactants within this data was also used as a separate prediction task
(Qin-Nonionics). The NIST dataset was collected from a different source and contained some molecules with very different chemistries than the above.

A linear model based on ECFPs demonstrated remarkably good performance, improving on a previous work \cite{qinPredictingCriticalMicelle2021} that applied a more complex GNN model, despite using a smaller number of parameters and having a much faster optimisation time. A new model was presented that improved the architecture of previous work's GNN and was capable of obtaining better performances than the ECFP model on the Qin-Nonionics task and
demonstrated a better ability to generalise to the NIST dataset.

Finally, a surrogate model was developed by feeding the latent space representation of a molecule, learned by the GNN model, to a Gaussian process.
This yielded uncertainty estimates alongside CMC predictions. Although this model appeared to fail when applied to the Qin-Nonionics task, it yielded the best predictive performance of all of the models for the Qin-All task, as well as
providing a good quality of uncertainty estimates allows researchers to gauge their confidence in the model's predictions.
