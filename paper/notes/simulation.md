Predicting CMC with simulations
===============================

Discuss two useful approaches:

- COSMO-RS-based methods.
- DPD-based methods.

COSMO-RS-based approaches
-------------------------

COSMO (Conductor-like screening model) treats a solute as a cavity in a dielectric continuum solvent;
in other words, as a volume that is capable of screening charge. The approach is based on calculating the
polarisation charges of the solvent-accessible surface of the molecule by splitting this area into individual segments
and applying a charge-scaling rule.
