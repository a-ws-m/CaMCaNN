  abstract = {Alternative methods for determining the critical micelle concentration (CMC) are proposed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the literature, the CMC value is commonly taken to be the ``free'' (unassociated) surfactant concentration in the presence of micellar aggregates given by MD simulations. In the present study, two surfactants with different head groups and the same alkyl tail, n-octyltrimethylammonium bromide (C8TAB) and sodium octyl sulfate (S8S), were used to calculate the CMC value. The CMC of surfactants can be calculated from the variation in the zero-shear-rate viscosity as a function of the surfactant concentration in both the premicellar and micellar regions. Linear slopes were obtained in both regions with increasing surfactant concentrations. The CMC values for C8TAB and S8S were determined from the intersection of the two lines and are in good agreement with experimental values.}

  abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only 'traditional' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

Both models suffer from overfitting or poor generalization in many cases. Deep networks include more hyper-parameters than shallow ones that increase the overfitting probability. This paper states a systematic review of the overfit controlling methods and categorizes them into passive, active, and semi-active subsets. A passive method designs a neural network before training, while an active method adapts a neural network along with the training process. A semi-active method redesigns a neural network when the training performance is poor. This review includes the theoretical and experimental backgrounds of these methods, their strengths and weaknesses, and the emerging techniques for overfitting detection. The adaptation of model complexity to the data complexity is another point in this review. The relation between overfitting control, regularization, network compression, and network simplification is also stated. The paper ends with some concluding lessons from the literature.},

An algorithm for extracting useful information from the topological and geometrical representation of chemical compounds was developed and integrated to calculate MDF members. The MDF methodology was implemented and the software is available online (http://l.academicdirect.org/Chemistry/SARs/MDF\_SARs/). This integrative tool was developed in order to maximize performance, functionality, efficiency and portability. The MDF methodology is able to provide reliable and valid multiple linear regression models. Furthermore, in many cases, the MDF models were better than the published results in the literature in terms of correlation coefficients (statistically significant Steiger's Z test at a significance level of 5\%) and/or in terms of values of information criteria and Kubinyi function. The MDF methodology developed and implemented as a platform for investigating and characterizing quantitative relationships between the chemical structure and the activity/property of active compounds was used on more than 50 study cases. In almost all cases, the methodology allowed obtaining of QSAR/QSPR models improved in explanatory power of structure-activity and structure-property relationships. The algorithms applied in the computation of geometric and topological descriptors (useful in modeling physicochemical or biological properties of molecules) and those used in searching for reliable and valid multiple linear regression models certain enrich the pool of low-cost low-time drug design tools.},

The implementation of J-P under Daylight software, using Daylight's fingerprints and the Tanimoto similarity index, can deal with sets of 100 k molecules in a matter of a few hours. However, the J-P clustering algorithm has several associated problems which make it difficult to cluster large data sets in a consistent and timely manner. The clusters produced are greatly dependent on the choice of the two parameters needed to run J-P clustering, such that this method tends to produce clusters which are either very large and heterogeneous or homogeneous but too small. In any case, J-P always requires time-consuming manual tuning. This paper describes an algorithm which will identify dense clusters where similarity within each cluster reflects the Tanimoto value used for the clustering, and, more importantly, where the cluster centroid will be at least similar, at the given Tanimoto value, to every other molecule within the cluster in a consistent and automated manner. The similarity term used throughout this paper reflects the overall similarity between two given molecules, as defined by Daylight's fingerprints and the Tanimoto similarity index.}

A generalized correlation for the interchange energy is proposed in this investigation. Satisfactory cmc calculation results (mole fraction) are obtained for 37 systems. The m-AD model has less number of generalized parameters in comparison to the theoretically based method, and shows better accuracy than that from other activity coefficient models.

We demonstrate that the MEGNet models outperform prior ML models such as the SchNet in 11 out of 13 properties of the QM9 molecule data set. Similarly, we show that MEGNet models trained on {$\sim$}60 000 crystals in the Materials Project substantially outperform prior ML models in the prediction of the formation energies, band gaps, and elastic moduli of crystals, achieving better than density functional theory accuracy over a much larger data set. We present two new strategies to address data limitations common in materials science and chemistry. First, we demonstrate a physically intuitive approach to unify four separate molecular MEGNet models for the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy into a single free energy MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure, and entropy as global state inputs. Second, we show that the learned element embeddings in MEGNet models encode periodic chemical trends and can be transfer-learned from a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to improve property models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic moduli).}

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},

  abstract = {A common frustration of using property models in general and group contribution models in particular is that the selected model may not have all the needed parameters, such as groups and/or their contributions needed to represent the molecular structure of the compound whose properties are to be estimated. Also, even if the groups are available, for some chemicals the set of groups may not be able to provide an acceptable level of prediction accuracy. One way to address these limitations with the group contribution approach is to add new groups. Addition of new groups, however, normally requires experimental data so that the new groups can be defined and their contributions estimated, which requires time and resources and is, therefore, not convenient for the model user. In this paper, a group contribution+ approach for pure-component properties, where missing groups are created and their contributions predicted through a set of zero-order and first-order connectivity indices, is presented.}

In this work, new quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) models for the critical micelle concentration (CMC) dedicated to sugar-based surfactants are proposed in order to reduce testing in a screening perspective. An important literature compilation allowed the constitution of a data set of 83 sugar-based surfactants for which accurate CMC values were found. Then, a series of QSPR models were developed based on molecular descriptors of the whole molecule and of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fragments taken separately. Different models were considered by including quantum-chemical descriptors with hope to access physically based models and by using only simple constitutional descriptors to favor fast and easy prediction. The best QSPR model was obtained including quantum-chemical descriptors of the whole molecular structure with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.32 (log) evaluated on a validation set of 27 molecules. A simpler model with good performances was also found (with a RMSE of 0.36 (log) on the validation set), including only constitutional-based fragment descriptors, that can be easily computed from the 2-dimension structure of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments.}

This work reviews the current state-of-the art, with emphasis on theory and methods rather than applications.

Nonelectrostatic interactions, which must be included in the model in order to obtain accurate solvation energies, are also described. Numerical techniques for implementing the equations are discussed, including linear-scaling algorithms that can be used in classical or mixed quantum/classical biomolecular electrostatics calculations.

Compared to COSMO-RS, this new approach needs structural information to account for the anisotropy of colloidal systems. This information can be obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we show that this combination of molecular methods can efficiently be used to predict partition coefficients with good agreement to experimental data and enables screening studies. However, there is a discrepancy between the amount of data generated by MD simulations and the structural information needed for COSMOmic. Therefore, a new scheme is presented to extract data from MD trajectories for COSMOmic calculations. In particular, we show how to calculate the system structure from MD, the influence of lipid conformers, the relation to the COSMOmic layer size, and the water/lipid ratio impact. For a 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) bilayer, 66 partition coefficients for various solutes were calculated. Further, 52 partition coefficients for a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer system were calculated. All these calculations were compared to experimental data. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The simulations are long enough to enable the observation of several processes leading to equilibrium, such as monomer addition and detachment, micelle dissolution, and micelle fusion. The self-assembly of DeTAB surfactants takes place in three stages: fast aggregation of monomers to form small disordered oligomers; ripening process by which larger aggregates grow at the expense of smaller ones; slower stage involving collisions between large micelles. The first two stages were described well by a simple kinetic model with a size-independent rate constant estimated from the self-diffusion coefficient and collision radius of an isolated monomer. The average cluster size, area per headgroup, degree of counterion dissociation, and critical micelle concentration estimated from the simulation are in reasonable agreement with experimental values. An all-atom and united-atom surfactant model were compared, and the results were seen to be almost independent of the choice of model. DeTAB micelles are spheroidal, with a hydrophobic core composed of tail atoms surrounded by a hydrophilic corona of head atoms. A Stern layer composed of bromide counterions was also identified. Water molecules solvate the counterions and the head atoms, penetrating into the micelle up to the location of the atom connecting the head to the aliphatic tail, in agreement with recent experimental observations.}

However, developing coarse-grained models and subsequently, the accurate interaction potentials (force-field parameters) is a challenging task. Traditional parameterisation techniques, although tedious, have been used extensively to develop CG models for a variety of solvent, soft-matter and biological systems. With the advent of sophisticated optimisation methods, machine learning, and hybrid approaches for force-field parameterisation, models with a higher degree of transferability and accuracy can be developed in a shorter period of time. We review here, some of these traditional and advanced parameterisation techniques while also shedding light on several transferable CG models developed in our group over the years using such an advanced method developed by us.

  abstract = {In this article, we focus on simulation methodologies to obtain the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and equilibrium distribution of aggregate sizes in dilute surfactant solutions. Even though it is now relatively easy to obtain micellar aggregates in simulations starting from a fully dispersed state, several major challenges remain. In particular, the characteristic times of micelle reorganization and transfer of monomers from micelles to free solution for most systems of practical interest exceed currently accessible molecular dynamics time scales for atomistic surfactant models in explicit solvent. In addition, it is impractical to simulate highly dilute systems near the cmc. We have demonstrated a strong dependence of the free surfactant concentration (frequently, but incorrectly, taken to represent the cmc in simulations) on the overall concentration for ionic surfactants. We have presented a theoretical framework for making the necessary extrapolations to the cmc. We find that currently available atomistic force fields systematically underpredict experimental cmc's, pointing to the need for the development of improved models. For strongly micellizing systems that exhibit strong hysteresis, implicit-solvent grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations represent an appealing alternative to atomistic or coarse-grained, explicit-solvent simulations. We summarize an approach that can be used to obtain quantitative, transferrable effective interactions and illustrate how this grand canonical approach can be used to interpret experimental scattering results.}

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

While it was originally restricted to homogeneous liquids, it later has been extended to the prediction of the free energy of molecules in inhomogeneous systems such as micelles, biomembranes, or liquid interfaces, but these calculations were based on external input about the structure of the inhomogeneous system. Here we report the rigorous extension of COSMO-RS to a self-consistent prediction of the structure and the free energies of molecules in self-organizing inhomogeneous systems. This extends the application range to many new areas, such as the prediction of micellar structures and critical micelle concentrations, finite loading effects in micelles and biomembranes, the free energies and structure of liquid interfaces, microemulsions, and many more related topics, which often are of great practical importance.},

Thus a C13 fatty acid soap, a C12 sulfonate, a C11 sulfate, and a C12 ammonium chloride have CMC values of 0.010\textendash 0.014M. Values of CMC are not changed to any extent by substitution near the hydrophilic head of one, two, or three groups, even as large as hydroxyethyl, in place of the amine hydrogens in the cationic detergents. However substitution with dihydroxypropyl groups has a marked effect on association in C12 but not in the C16 series, indicating that the relative lengths of the two chains must be considered as an important factor in association. This is well illustrated in the dialkylsulfosuccinate series, and in a tetradecane sulfate series in which the -SO4Na group was progressively moved down the chain, particularly when the branched chain compounds are compared with the corresponding straight chain detergents of length equal to the maximum length from the charged head to the ultimate carbon atom. Introduction of double bonds causes a small but definite increase in CMC whereas polar substitution in the chain results in a marked increase in CMC. Possible micelle structures are discussed in the light of these association phenomena, and it is concluded that the assignment of a definite size and shape to micelles appears at the present time to be slightly premature. However if one includes the concept of relative order-disorder in the micelle as one of the factors, in addition to chain length, type of detergent, and environment, which are important in micelle structure, it is possible to explain partially the apparent marked differences which have been reported for micelles of different surface active agents.},

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},

The ``solubility challenge'' was a widely recognized success and spurred many discussions about the prediction methods and quality of data. We revisited the competition a second time recently and challenged the community to a different challenge, not a blind test this time but using a larger test set of molecules, gathered and curated from published sources (mostly ``gold standard'' saturation shake-flask measurements), where the average interlaboratory reproducibility for the molecules was estimated to be {$\sim$}0.17 log unit. Also, a second test set was included, comprising ``contentious'' molecules, the reported (mostly shake-flask) solubility of which had higher average uncertainty, {$\sim$}0.62 log unit. In the second competition, the participants were invited to use their own training sets, provided that the training sets did not contain any of the test set molecules. We were motivated to revisit the competition to (1) examine to what extent computational methods had improved in 10 years, (2) verify that data quality may not be the main limiting factor in the accuracy of the prediction method, and (3) attempt to seek a relationship between the makeup of the training set data and the prediction outcome.}

The model is based on the Marrero and Gani GC method. A systematic analysis of the model performance against experimental data is carried out using data for a wide range of nonionic surfactants covering a wide range of molecular structures. As a result of this procedure, new third order groups based on the characteristic structures of nonionic surfactants are defined and are included in the Marrero and Gani GC model. In this way, those compounds that exhibit larger correlation errors (based only on first- and second-order groups) are assigned to more detailed molecular descriptions, so that better correlations of critical micelle concentrations are obtained. The group parameter estimation has been performed using a data set of 150 experimental measurements covering a large variety of nonionic surfactants including linear, branched, and phenyl alkyl ethoxylates; alkanediols; alkyl mono- and disaccharide ethers and esters; ethoxylated alkyl amines and amides; fluorinated linear ethoxylates and amides; polyglycerol esters; and carbohydrate derivate ethers, esters, and thiols. The model developed consists of linear group contributions, and the critical micelle concentration is estimated using the molecular structure of the nonionic surfactant alone. Compared to other models used for the prediction of the critical micelle concentration, and in particular, the quantitative structure\textendash property relationship models, the developed GC model provides an accurate correlation and allows for an easier and faster application in computer-aided molecular design techniques facilitating chemical process and product design.}

  abstract = {Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules that are widely used in consumer products, industrial processes, and biological applications. A critical property of a surfactant is the critical micelle concentration (CMC), which is the concentration at which surfactant molecules undergo cooperative self-assembly in solution. Notably, the primary method to obtain CMCs experimentally\textemdash tensiometry\textemdash is laborious and expensive. In this study, we show that graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) can predict CMCs directly from the surfactant molecular structure. In particular, we developed a GCN architecture that encodes the surfactant structure in the form of a molecular graph and trained it using experimental CMC data. We found that the GCN can predict CMCs with higher accuracy on a more inclusive data set than previously proposed methods and that it can generalize to anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, and nonionic surfactants using a single model. Molecular saliency maps revealed how atom types and surfactant molecular substructures contribute to CMCs and found this behavior to be in agreement with physical rules that correlate constitutional and topological information to CMCs. Following such rules, we proposed a small set of new surfactants for which experimental CMCs are not available; for these molecules, CMCs predicted with our GCN exhibited similar trends to those obtained from molecular simulations. These results provide evidence that GCNs can enable high-throughput screening of surfactants with desired self-assembly characteristics.}

  abstract = {Commercial surfactants have widespread use in many practical applications, including detergents, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, enhanced oil recovery, and surfactant-based separation processes. However, despite their practical relevance, the solution behavior of commercial surfactants is not well understood at a fundamental molecular level. With this in mind, a new computational approach, based on a recently developed molecular-thermodynamic theory of mixed micellization, was developed to predict the critical micelle concentrations of commercial surfactants containing any number of surfactant components. The new computational approach was then implemented, in the context of two user-friendly computer programs, PREDICT and MIX2, to molecularly predict the critical micelle concentrations of several commercial surfactants of known chemical composition, including their binary mixtures. The commercial surfactants examined include the cationic BTC-8358, the nonionics GENAPOL UD-079, GENAPOL UD-110, GENAPOL 26-L-98, and GENAPOL 26-L-50, and the anionic STEOL CS-330. The accuracy of the predicted critical micelle concentrations was found to be comparable to that attained in the case of single (pure) surfactants and their binary mixtures, thus demonstrating the practical utility of the computer-assisted molecular-thermodynamic modeling as a predictive tool in commercial surfactant characterization.}

The frequently employed quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPRs/QSARs) characterize molecules by descriptors which are then mapped to the properties of interest via a linear or nonlinear model. In contrast, graph neural networks, a novel machine learning method, directly work on the molecular graph, i.e., a graph representation where atoms correspond to nodes and bonds correspond to edges. GNNs allow to learn properties in an end-to-end fashion, thereby avoiding the need for informative descriptors as in QSPRs/QSARs. GNNs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance on various property predictions tasks and represent an active field of research. We describe the fundamentals of GNNs and demonstrate the application of GNNs via two examples for molecular property prediction.},

ECFPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.}

  abstract = {The ability of surfactant molecules to facilitate solubilization of essential chemical entities accounts for their wide application in the pharmaceutical industry. The solubilization ability begins at concentrations exceeding the critical micelle concentration (CMC) which in turn is influenced by the molecular structure of the surfactants. Here, attempts have been made to explore the essential molecular fragments determining CMC of cationic surfactants using in silico technique. Different classes of descriptors (ETA and non-ETA) were correlated with the CMC data of a series of cationic surfactants to develop predictive models. Models were developed using genetic function approximation technique and were extensively validated employing different validation statistics. Comparative analysis was performed between the best model developed using the ETA descriptors and that obtained with the non-ETA variables. The results revealed that the external predictive potential of the ETA model was superior to the non-ETA model. The results also indicated that the ETA model could efficiently determine the CMC profile of the untested molecules. Finally, the two classes of descriptors were combined and the QSPR model thus obtained exhibited improved external predictive potential. The ETA descriptors implicated the importance of molecular size and their degree of unsaturation while the non-ETA descriptors signified impact of the bond order and the number of fragments bearing hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms with variable hybridization. Thus, addition of ETA descriptors improved the model quality extensively identifying essential molecular fragments contributing to their CMC profile and can be comprehensively utilized for property prediction of new cationic surfactants.},

Here, we describe interpretation techniques for atomistic neural networks on the example of Behler\textendash Parrinello networks as well as the end-to-end model SchNet. Both models obtain predictions of chemical properties by aggregating atom-wise contributions. These latent variables can serve as local explanations of a prediction and are obtained during training without additional cost. Due to their correspondence to well-known chemical concepts such as atomic energies and partial charges, these atom-wise explanations enable insights not only about the model but more importantly about the underlying quantum-chemical regularities. We generalize from atomistic explanations to 3d space, thus obtaining spatially resolved visualizations which further improve interpretability. Finally, we analyze learned embeddings of chemical elements that exhibit a partial ordering that resembles the order of the periodic table. As the examined neural networks show excellent agreement with chemical knowledge, the presented techniques open up new venues for data-driven research in chemistry, physics and materials science.},

Machine learning (ML), combining a data-based and knowledge-based approach, can provide a powerful means to relate molecular descriptors to SFT profiles. Experiments A dataset of SFT for 154 model hydrocarbon surfactants at 20\textendash 30 \textdegree C is fitted to the Szyszkowski equation to extract three characteristic parameters ({$\Gamma$}max,KL and critical micelle concentration (CMC)) which are correlated to a series of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors. Key ({$\sim$}10) descriptors were selected by removing co-correlation, and employing a gradient-boosted regressor model to rank feature importance and carry out recursive feature elimination (RFE). The hyperparameters of each target-variable model were fine-tuned using a randomised cross-validated grid search, to improve predictive ability and reduce overfitting. Findings The ML models correlate favourably with test experimental data, with R2= 0.69\textendash 0.87, and the merits and limitations of the approach are discussed based on `unseen' hydrocarbon surfactants. The incorporation of a knowledge-based framework provides an appropriate smoothing of the experimental data which simplifies the data-driven approach and enhances its generality.

It is therefore no surprise that the aqueous solubility of compounds has a key role in various domains, including but not limited to drug discovery, paint, coating, and battery materials design. Measurement and prediction of aqueous solubility is a complex and prevailing challenge in chemistry. For the latter, different data-driven prediction models have recently been developed to augment the physics-based modeling approaches. To construct accurate data-driven estimation models, it is essential that the underlying experimental calibration data used by these models is of high fidelity and quality. Existing solubility datasets show variance in the chemical space of compounds covered, measurement methods, experimental conditions, but also in the non-standard representations, size, and accessibility of data. To address this problem, we generated a new database of compounds, AqSolDB, by merging a total of nine different aqueous solubility datasets, curating the merged data, standardizing and validating the compound representation formats, marking with reliability labels, and providing 2D descriptors of compounds as a Supplementary Resource.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant.

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.}

This suite probes the accuracy, calibration, and sharpness of a model quantitatively. We then show a case study where we judge various methods for predicting density-functional-theory-calculated adsorption energies.

We present a set of simple guidelines for developing validated and predictive QSPR models. To this end, we discuss several validation strategies including (1) randomization of the modelled property, also called Y-scrambling, (2) multiple leave-many-out cross-validations, and (3) external validation using rational division of a dataset into training and test sets. We also highlight the need to establish the domain of model applicability in the chemical space to flag molecules for which predictions may be unreliable, and discuss some algorithms that can be used for this purpose.

The critical micelle concentration can be determined experimentally with a tensiometer by measuring the surface tension of a concentration series. In analogy with experiments, in-silico predictions can be achieved through interfacial tension calculations. We present a newly developed method, which employs first principles-based interfacial tension calculations rooted in COSMO-RS theory, for the prediction of the critical micelle concentration of a set of nonionic, cationic, anionic, and zwitterionic surfactants in water. Our approach consists of a combination of two prediction strategies for modelling two different phenomena involving the removal of the surfactant hydrophobic tail from contact with water. The two strategies are based on regular micelle formation and thermodynamic phase separation of the surfactant from water and both are required to take into account a wide range of polarity in the hydrophilic headgroup. Our method yields accurate predictions for the critical micellar concentration, within one log unit from experiments, for a wide range of surfactant types and introduces possibilities for first-principles based prediction of formulation properties for more complex compositions.},

However, successful attempts of quantitative modeling confirmed by experimental data remains limited. We show, for the first time, that the dissipative particle dynamics with rigorously defined soft repulsion interaction and rigidity parameters is capable of predicting micellar self-assembly of nonionic surfactants. This is achieved due to a novel approach suggested for defining the interaction parameters by fitting to the infinite dilution activity coefficients of binary solutions formed by reference compounds that represent coarse-grained fragments of surfactant molecules. Using this new parametrization scheme, we obtained quantitative agreement with the experimental critical micelle concentration and aggregation number for several typical surfactants of different chemical structures. The proposed approach can be extended to various colloidal and polymeric systems beyond nonionic surfactant solutions.}

  abstract = {Methodological problems of using fragmental descriptors for construction of QSAR/QSPR equations are considered, and the main achievements in this field are summarized and discussed. If a structure-property data set is sufficiently large to allow building statistically significant models, then any topological index can be replaced with a set of fragmental descriptors. Several examples of using the fragmental approach for predicting retention indices and the normal boiling points of organic compounds are considered. Advantages of using fragmental descriptors, namely a ``transparency'' and interpretability of QSAR/QSPR models, are exemplified.}

  abstract = {Summary. We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p{$\gg$}n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},
