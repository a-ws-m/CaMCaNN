  abstract = {Sugar-based surfactants represent a fruitful field of research in the context of sustainable chemistry since they can be obtained from renewable resources. In this work, new quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) models for the critical micelle concentration (CMC) dedicated to sugar-based surfactants are proposed in order to reduce testing in a screening perspective. An important literature compilation allowed the constitution of a data set of 83 sugar-based surfactants for which accurate CMC values were found. Then, a series of QSPR models were developed based on molecular descriptors of the whole molecule and of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fragments taken separately. Different models were considered by including quantum-chemical descriptors with hope to access physically based models and by using only simple constitutional descriptors to favor fast and easy prediction. The best QSPR model was obtained including quantum-chemical descriptors of the whole molecular structure with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.32 (log) evaluated on a validation set of 27 molecules. A simpler model with good performances was also found (with a RMSE of 0.36 (log) on the validation set), including only constitutional-based fragment descriptors, that can be easily computed from the 2-dimension structure of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments.},

Thus a C13 fatty acid soap, a C12 sulfonate, a C11 sulfate, and a C12 ammonium chloride have CMC values of 0.010\textendash 0.014M. Values of CMC are not changed to any extent by substitution near the hydrophilic head of one, two, or three groups, even as large as hydroxyethyl, in place of the amine hydrogens in the cationic detergents. However substitution with dihydroxypropyl groups has a marked effect on association in C12 but not in the C16 series, indicating that the relative lengths of the two chains must be considered as an important factor in association. This is well illustrated in the dialkylsulfosuccinate series, and in a tetradecane sulfate series in which the -SO4Na group was progressively moved down the chain, particularly when the branched chain compounds are compared with the corresponding straight chain detergents of length equal to the maximum length from the charged head to the ultimate carbon atom. Introduction of double bonds causes a small but definite increase in CMC whereas polar substitution in the chain results in a marked increase in CMC. Possible micelle structures are discussed in the light of these association phenomena, and it is concluded that the assignment of a definite size and shape to micelles appears at the present time to be slightly premature. However if one includes the concept of relative order-disorder in the micelle as one of the factors, in addition to chain length, type of detergent, and environment, which are important in micelle structure, it is possible to explain partially the apparent marked differences which have been reported for micelles of different surface active agents.},

  abstract = {A group-contribution (GC) property prediction model for estimating the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of nonionic surfactants in water at 25 \textdegree C is presented. The model is based on the Marrero and Gani GC method. A systematic analysis of the model performance against experimental data is carried out using data for a wide range of nonionic surfactants covering a wide range of molecular structures. As a result of this procedure, new third order groups based on the characteristic structures of nonionic surfactants are defined and are included in the Marrero and Gani GC model. In this way, those compounds that exhibit larger correlation errors (based only on first- and second-order groups) are assigned to more detailed molecular descriptions, so that better correlations of critical micelle concentrations are obtained. The group parameter estimation has been performed using a data set of 150 experimental measurements covering a large variety of nonionic surfactants including linear, branched, and phenyl alkyl ethoxylates; alkanediols; alkyl mono- and disaccharide ethers and esters; ethoxylated alkyl amines and amides; fluorinated linear ethoxylates and amides; polyglycerol esters; and carbohydrate derivate ethers, esters, and thiols. The model developed consists of linear group contributions, and the critical micelle concentration is estimated using the molecular structure of the nonionic surfactant alone. Compared to other models used for the prediction of the critical micelle concentration, and in particular, the quantitative structure\textendash property relationship models, the developed GC model provides an accurate correlation and allows for an easier and faster application in computer-aided molecular design techniques facilitating chemical process and product design.}

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to specifying a molecular mechanics force field encode all the information needed to assign force field parameters to a given molecule into a discrete set of atom types. This is equivalent to a representation consisting of a molecular graph comprising a set of vertices, which represent atoms labeled by atom type, and unlabeled edges, which represent chemical bonds. Bond stretch, angle bend, and dihedral parameters are then assigned by looking up bonded pairs, triplets, and quartets of atom types in parameter tables to assign valence terms and using the atom types themselves to assign nonbonded parameters. This approach, which we call indirect chemical perception because it operates on the intermediate graph of atom-typed nodes, creates a number of technical problems. For example, atom types must be sufficiently complex to encode all necessary information about the molecular environment, making it difficult to extend force fields encoded this way. Atom typing also results in a proliferation of redundant parameters applied to chemically equivalent classes of valence terms, needlessly increasing force field complexity. Here, we describe a new approach to assigning force field parameters via direct chemical perception. Rather than working through the intermediary of the atom-typed graph, direct chemical perception operates directly on the unmodified chemical graph of the molecule to assign parameters. In particular, parameters are assigned to each type of force field term (e.g., bond stretch, angle bend, torsion, and Lennard\textendash Jones) based on standard chemical substructure queries implemented via the industry-standard SMARTS chemical perception language, using SMIRKS extensions that permit labeling of specific atoms within a chemical pattern. We use this to implement a new force field format, called the SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) format. We demonstrate the power and generality of this approach using examples of specific molecules that pose problems for indirect chemical perception and construct and validate a minimalist yet very general force field, SMIRNOFF99Frosst. We find that a parameter definition file only {$\sim$}300 lines long provides coverage of all but {$<$}0.02\% of a 5 million molecule drug-like test set. Despite its simplicity, the accuracy of SMIRNOFF99Frosst for small molecule hydration free energies and selected properties of pure organic liquids is similar to that of the General Amber Force Field, whose specification requires thousands of parameters. This force field provides a starting point for further optimization and refitting work to follow.}

  abstract = {Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules that are widely used in consumer products, industrial processes, and biological applications. A critical property of a surfactant is the critical micelle concentration (CMC), which is the concentration at which surfactant molecules undergo cooperative self-assembly in solution. Notably, the primary method to obtain CMCs experimentally\textemdash tensiometry\textemdash is laborious and expensive. In this study, we show that graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) can predict CMCs directly from the surfactant molecular structure. In particular, we developed a GCN architecture that encodes the surfactant structure in the form of a molecular graph and trained it using experimental CMC data. We found that the GCN can predict CMCs with higher accuracy on a more inclusive data set than previously proposed methods and that it can generalize to anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, and nonionic surfactants using a single model. Molecular saliency maps revealed how atom types and surfactant molecular substructures contribute to CMCs and found this behavior to be in agreement with physical rules that correlate constitutional and topological information to CMCs. Following such rules, we proposed a small set of new surfactants for which experimental CMCs are not available; for these molecules, CMCs predicted with our GCN exhibited similar trends to those obtained from molecular simulations. These results provide evidence that GCNs can enable high-throughput screening of surfactants with desired self-assembly characteristics.}

The frequently employed quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPRs/QSARs) characterize molecules by descriptors which are then mapped to the properties of interest via a linear or nonlinear model. In contrast, graph neural networks, a novel machine learning method, directly work on the molecular graph, i.e., a graph representation where atoms correspond to nodes and bonds correspond to edges. GNNs allow to learn properties in an end-to-end fashion, thereby avoiding the need for informative descriptors as in QSPRs/QSARs. GNNs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance on various property predictions tasks and represent an active field of research. We describe the fundamentals of GNNs and demonstrate the application of GNNs via two examples for molecular property prediction.},

While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.}

Here, we describe interpretation techniques for atomistic neural networks on the example of Behler\textendash Parrinello networks as well as the end-to-end model SchNet. Both models obtain predictions of chemical properties by aggregating atom-wise contributions. These latent variables can serve as local explanations of a prediction and are obtained during training without additional cost. Due to their correspondence to well-known chemical concepts such as atomic energies and partial charges, these atom-wise explanations enable insights not only about the model but more importantly about the underlying quantum-chemical regularities. We generalize from atomistic explanations to 3d space, thus obtaining spatially resolved visualizations which further improve interpretability. Finally, we analyze learned embeddings of chemical elements that exhibit a partial ordering that resembles the order of the periodic table. As the examined neural networks show excellent agreement with chemical knowledge, the presented techniques open up new venues for data-driven research in chemistry, physics and materials science.},
