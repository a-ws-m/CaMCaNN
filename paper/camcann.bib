  abstract = {Shallow neural networks process the features directly, while deep networks extract features automatically along with the training. Both models suffer from overfitting or poor generalization in many cases. Deep networks include more hyper-parameters than shallow ones that increase the overfitting probability. This paper states a systematic review of the overfit controlling methods and categorizes them into passive, active, and semi-active subsets. A passive method designs a neural network before training, while an active method adapts a neural network along with the training process. A semi-active method redesigns a neural network when the training performance is poor. This review includes the theoretical and experimental backgrounds of these methods, their strengths and weaknesses, and the emerging techniques for overfitting detection. The adaptation of model complexity to the data complexity is another point in this review. The relation between overfitting control, regularization, network compression, and network simplification is also stated. The paper ends with some concluding lessons from the literature.},

The only adjustable parameter required in the m-AD model is the interchange energy. In surfactant system calculations, this parameter is found as a strong function of the physical properties of surfactants. A generalized correlation for the interchange energy is proposed in this investigation. Satisfactory cmc calculation results (mole fraction) are obtained for 37 systems. The m-AD model has less number of generalized parameters in comparison to the theoretically based method, and shows better accuracy than that from other activity coefficient models. Predictions of the cmc values (mole fraction) for mixed nonionic surfactants systems are also applicable using this m-AD model.},

Here, we develop universal MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) models for accurate property prediction in both molecules and crystals. We demonstrate that the MEGNet models outperform prior ML models such as the SchNet in 11 out of 13 properties of the QM9 molecule data set. Similarly, we show that MEGNet models trained on {$\sim$}60 000 crystals in the Materials Project substantially outperform prior ML models in the prediction of the formation energies, band gaps, and elastic moduli of crystals, achieving better than density functional theory accuracy over a much larger data set. We present two new strategies to address data limitations common in materials science and chemistry. First, we demonstrate a physically intuitive approach to unify four separate molecular MEGNet models for the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy into a single free energy MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure, and entropy as global state inputs. Second, we show that the learned element embeddings in MEGNet models encode periodic chemical trends and can be transfer-learned from a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to improve property models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic moduli).}

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

The representations are compared for a Laplacian kernel with Manhattan norm, trained to reproduce formation energies using a dataset of 3938 crystal structures obtained from the Materials Project.

In this work, new quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) models for the critical micelle concentration (CMC) dedicated to sugar-based surfactants are proposed in order to reduce testing in a screening perspective. An important literature compilation allowed the constitution of a data set of 83 sugar-based surfactants for which accurate CMC values were found. Then, a series of QSPR models were developed based on molecular descriptors of the whole molecule and of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fragments taken separately. Different models were considered by including quantum-chemical descriptors with hope to access physically based models and by using only simple constitutional descriptors to favor fast and easy prediction. The best QSPR model was obtained including quantum-chemical descriptors of the whole molecular structure with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.32 (log) evaluated on a validation set of 27 molecules. A simpler model with good performances was also found (with a RMSE of 0.36 (log) on the validation set), including only constitutional-based fragment descriptors, that can be easily computed from the 2-dimension structure of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments.}

Thus a C13 fatty acid soap, a C12 sulfonate, a C11 sulfate, and a C12 ammonium chloride have CMC values of 0.010\textendash 0.014M. Values of CMC are not changed to any extent by substitution near the hydrophilic head of one, two, or three groups, even as large as hydroxyethyl, in place of the amine hydrogens in the cationic detergents. However substitution with dihydroxypropyl groups has a marked effect on association in C12 but not in the C16 series, indicating that the relative lengths of the two chains must be considered as an important factor in association. This is well illustrated in the dialkylsulfosuccinate series, and in a tetradecane sulfate series in which the -SO4Na group was progressively moved down the chain, particularly when the branched chain compounds are compared with the corresponding straight chain detergents of length equal to the maximum length from the charged head to the ultimate carbon atom. Introduction of double bonds causes a small but definite increase in CMC whereas polar substitution in the chain results in a marked increase in CMC. Possible micelle structures are discussed in the light of these association phenomena, and it is concluded that the assignment of a definite size and shape to micelles appears at the present time to be slightly premature. However if one includes the concept of relative order-disorder in the micelle as one of the factors, in addition to chain length, type of detergent, and environment, which are important in micelle structure, it is possible to explain partially the apparent marked differences which have been reported for micelles of different surface active agents.},

Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/).

  abstract = {A group-contribution (GC) property prediction model for estimating the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of nonionic surfactants in water at 25 \textdegree C is presented. The model is based on the Marrero and Gani GC method. A systematic analysis of the model performance against experimental data is carried out using data for a wide range of nonionic surfactants covering a wide range of molecular structures. As a result of this procedure, new third order groups based on the characteristic structures of nonionic surfactants are defined and are included in the Marrero and Gani GC model. In this way, those compounds that exhibit larger correlation errors (based only on first- and second-order groups) are assigned to more detailed molecular descriptions, so that better correlations of critical micelle concentrations are obtained. The group parameter estimation has been performed using a data set of 150 experimental measurements covering a large variety of nonionic surfactants including linear, branched, and phenyl alkyl ethoxylates; alkanediols; alkyl mono- and disaccharide ethers and esters; ethoxylated alkyl amines and amides; fluorinated linear ethoxylates and amides; polyglycerol esters; and carbohydrate derivate ethers, esters, and thiols. The model developed consists of linear group contributions, and the critical micelle concentration is estimated using the molecular structure of the nonionic surfactant alone. Compared to other models used for the prediction of the critical micelle concentration, and in particular, the quantitative structure\textendash property relationship models, the developed GC model provides an accurate correlation and allows for an easier and faster application in computer-aided molecular design techniques facilitating chemical process and product design.}

A critical property of a surfactant is the critical micelle concentration (CMC), which is the concentration at which surfactant molecules undergo cooperative self-assembly in solution. Notably, the primary method to obtain CMCs experimentally\textemdash tensiometry\textemdash is laborious and expensive. In this study, we show that graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) can predict CMCs directly from the surfactant molecular structure. In particular, we developed a GCN architecture that encodes the surfactant structure in the form of a molecular graph and trained it using experimental CMC data. We found that the GCN can predict CMCs with higher accuracy on a more inclusive data set than previously proposed methods and that it can generalize to anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, and nonionic surfactants using a single model. Molecular saliency maps revealed how atom types and surfactant molecular substructures contribute to CMCs and found this behavior to be in agreement with physical rules that correlate constitutional and topological information to CMCs. Following such rules, we proposed a small set of new surfactants for which experimental CMCs are not available; for these molecules, CMCs predicted with our GCN exhibited similar trends to those obtained from molecular simulations. These results provide evidence that GCNs can enable high-throughput screening of surfactants with desired self-assembly characteristics.}

  abstract = {Commercial surfactants have widespread use in many practical applications, including detergents, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, enhanced oil recovery, and surfactant-based separation processes. However, despite their practical relevance, the solution behavior of commercial surfactants is not well understood at a fundamental molecular level. With this in mind, a new computational approach, based on a recently developed molecular-thermodynamic theory of mixed micellization, was developed to predict the critical micelle concentrations of commercial surfactants containing any number of surfactant components. The new computational approach was then implemented, in the context of two user-friendly computer programs, PREDICT and MIX2, to molecularly predict the critical micelle concentrations of several commercial surfactants of known chemical composition, including their binary mixtures. The commercial surfactants examined include the cationic BTC-8358, the nonionics GENAPOL UD-079, GENAPOL UD-110, GENAPOL 26-L-98, and GENAPOL 26-L-50, and the anionic STEOL CS-330. The accuracy of the predicted critical micelle concentrations was found to be comparable to that attained in the case of single (pure) surfactants and their binary mixtures, thus demonstrating the practical utility of the computer-assisted molecular-thermodynamic modeling as a predictive tool in commercial surfactant characterization.}

The frequently employed quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPRs/QSARs) characterize molecules by descriptors which are then mapped to the properties of interest via a linear or nonlinear model. In contrast, graph neural networks, a novel machine learning method, directly work on the molecular graph, i.e., a graph representation where atoms correspond to nodes and bonds correspond to edges. GNNs allow to learn properties in an end-to-end fashion, thereby avoiding the need for informative descriptors as in QSPRs/QSARs. GNNs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance on various property predictions tasks and represent an active field of research. We describe the fundamentals of GNNs and demonstrate the application of GNNs via two examples for molecular property prediction.},

The solubilization ability begins at concentrations exceeding the critical micelle concentration (CMC) which in turn is influenced by the molecular structure of the surfactants. Here, attempts have been made to explore the essential molecular fragments determining CMC of cationic surfactants using in silico technique. Different classes of descriptors (ETA and non-ETA) were correlated with the CMC data of a series of cationic surfactants to develop predictive models. Models were developed using genetic function approximation technique and were extensively validated employing different validation statistics. Comparative analysis was performed between the best model developed using the ETA descriptors and that obtained with the non-ETA variables. The results revealed that the external predictive potential of the ETA model was superior to the non-ETA model. The results also indicated that the ETA model could efficiently determine the CMC profile of the untested molecules. Finally, the two classes of descriptors were combined and the QSPR model thus obtained exhibited improved external predictive potential. The ETA descriptors implicated the importance of molecular size and their degree of unsaturation while the non-ETA descriptors signified impact of the bond order and the number of fragments bearing hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms with variable hybridization. Thus, addition of ETA descriptors improved the model quality extensively identifying essential molecular fragments contributing to their CMC profile and can be comprehensively utilized for property prediction of new cationic surfactants.},

Here, we describe interpretation techniques for atomistic neural networks on the example of Behler\textendash Parrinello networks as well as the end-to-end model SchNet. Both models obtain predictions of chemical properties by aggregating atom-wise contributions. These latent variables can serve as local explanations of a prediction and are obtained during training without additional cost. Due to their correspondence to well-known chemical concepts such as atomic energies and partial charges, these atom-wise explanations enable insights not only about the model but more importantly about the underlying quantum-chemical regularities. We generalize from atomistic explanations to 3d space, thus obtaining spatially resolved visualizations which further improve interpretability. Finally, we analyze learned embeddings of chemical elements that exhibit a partial ordering that resembles the order of the periodic table. As the examined neural networks show excellent agreement with chemical knowledge, the presented techniques open up new venues for data-driven research in chemistry, physics and materials science.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.}

The critical micelle concentration can be determined experimentally with a tensiometer by measuring the surface tension of a concentration series.

We present a newly developed method, which employs first principles-based interfacial tension calculations rooted in COSMO-RS theory, for the prediction of the critical micelle concentration of a set of nonionic, cationic, anionic, and zwitterionic surfactants in water. Our approach consists of a combination of two prediction strategies for modelling two different phenomena involving the removal of the surfactant hydrophobic tail from contact with water. The two strategies are based on regular micelle formation and thermodynamic phase separation of the surfactant from water and both are required to take into account a wide range of polarity in the hydrophilic headgroup. Our method yields accurate predictions for the critical micellar concentration, within one log unit from experiments, for a wide range of surfactant types and introduces possibilities for first-principles based prediction of formulation properties for more complex compositions.},

However, successful attempts of quantitative modeling confirmed by experimental data remains limited. We show, for the first time, that the dissipative particle dynamics with rigorously defined soft repulsion interaction and rigidity parameters is capable of predicting micellar self-assembly of nonionic surfactants. This is achieved due to a novel approach suggested for defining the interaction parameters by fitting to the infinite dilution activity coefficients of binary solutions formed by reference compounds that represent coarse-grained fragments of surfactant molecules. Using this new parametrization scheme, we obtained quantitative agreement with the experimental critical micelle concentration and aggregation number for several typical surfactants of different chemical structures. The proposed approach can be extended to various colloidal and polymeric systems beyond nonionic surfactant solutions.}
